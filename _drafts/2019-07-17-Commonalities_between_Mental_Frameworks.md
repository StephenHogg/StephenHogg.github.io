title: "Is there a simpler way of talking about Flow?"

There are plenty of self-help books out there these days. Some of them are even helpful. One that's particularly interesting to me is _Flow_ by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.


It's possible to see hazy similarities between Flow, the Atomic Habits approach and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - does this tell us anything?
