            How to avoid doing semi-supervised learning

        </h3><p>I’ve been using Duolingo for about 470 days now to learn Chinese. There are a few things I’ve learned on the way, but mostly I’ve learned to apply the lessons of a book I read partway through this journey. In this post, I’ll talk about that and what it leads me to think about how to turn this blog into a durable habit.</p>

        </h3><p>Oh my god this happens all the time I swear. If you’re working in machine learning then it is unavoidable that you work in the presence of uncertainty. This isn’t such a bad thing, but how we think as humans sometimes works against us when dealing with uncertainty. This post will look something that commonly goes wrong and more importantly, how to spot it so you can do something about it.</p>

            How to automatically shoot yourself in the foot
          </a>
        </h3><p>There are plenty of wonderful ways to screw up a perfectly good model. All of them share one common thread, which is that it’s always possible to shoot yourself in the foot. Even funnier (from my point of view at least), is that the urge to shoot oneself in the foot increases as the complexity of the model you’re working with does. In this post I’ll discuss one simple way of achieving a precision shot by means of automating a parameter search.</p>

It’s worth reinforcing, it’s a great resource and an example to us all about where academic collaboration can lead.</p>

            Transformers: more than meets the eye? (Part 1: The Past)
          </a>
        </h3><p>There’s quite a lot of talk about how wonderful Transformers are and how they solve a lot of problems. Fair enough, they are pretty good. That said, all the explanations I’ve seen so far include math and neural network diagrams (nothing wrong with that!). What I’m going to attempt to do is talk about how they work in a more conceptual way, because it’s much easier to understand the math and diagrams if you have some idea of why those equations even exist.</p>
