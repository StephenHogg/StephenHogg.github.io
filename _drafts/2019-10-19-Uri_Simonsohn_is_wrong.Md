title: "Uri Simonsohn is wrong about hypothesis testing"
---

 A friend of mine[^1] recently drew my attention to a (blog post)[http://datacolada.org/78a#identifier_1_4197] he thought I would find interesting. I'm told it's influential in the experimental social science world, for a couple of reasons. The primary one is that the author - Uri Simonsohn - is concerned about a lack of methodological rigour in his field. Good on him for doing something about it! He's also definitely on the money with his argument in (this paper)[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oY9xV3EAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26user%3DoY9xV3EAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DoY9xV3EAAAAJ%3ARGFaLdJalmkC], which roughly boils down to the argument that anything looks significant if you squint hard enough.
 
 So two cheers for Uri. The blog post of his that I read has some problems, however. The most fundamental of these is his use of the phrase "accept the null". This is flat out wrong and suggests he may not fully understand how hypothesis testing works. Particularly given that there's (another blog post by him)[http://datacolada.org/42] that is in fact entitled "Accepting the Null" and is all about when it's acceptable to do so.[^2]
 
 [^1]: who shall, of course, remain nameless
 [^2]: it's never acceptable to do so - I'll try and spell out why.
