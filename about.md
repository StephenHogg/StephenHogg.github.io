title: "About me"
--- -->

I'm Stephen and I live in Sydney. I'm the head of ML at [iSentia](http://www.isentia.com), but used to be an economist and before that an aspiring interpreter. Life is funny like that sometimes.

I'm also one of the organisers of the [Sydney NLP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Natural-Language-Processing-Meetup/), which you should definitely come along to and check out if you're in town!

This blog isn't really intended to set anyone's world on fire, but might hopefully provide some useful context. Also I reserve the right to go radically off-script where appropriate.

Also I honestly don't care how many page views this get because I'm only really worried about keeping myself and a few others entertained, so there won't be any google analytics tracking here or anything like that. If you like what you read, let me know!
