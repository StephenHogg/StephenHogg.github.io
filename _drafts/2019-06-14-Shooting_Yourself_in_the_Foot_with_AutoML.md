title: "How to automatically shoot yourself in the foot"
---

There are plenty of wonderful ways to screw up a perfectly good model. All of them share one common thread, which is that it's always possible to shoot yourself in the foot. Even funnier (from my point of view at least), is that the urge to shoot oneself in the foot increases as the complexity of the model you're working with does. To be clear, let's define shooting oneself in the foot:

This partly (but not completely), explains a fair bit of the interest in automating the search for an acceptable neural network architecture. 

In this post I'll discuss one simple way of achieving this by means of automated ML, given that's all the rage at the moment.
