title: "Things I've learnt from one-and-a-bit years of Duolingo"
---

I've been using Duolingo for about 470 days now to learn Chinese. There are a few things I've learned on the way, but mostly I've learned to apply the lessons of a book I read partway through this journey. In this post, I'll talk about that and what it leads me to think about how to turn this blog into a durable habit.

# Pretty clear, I guess

The book is _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear.[^1] The basic premise of the book is that we can improve our lives quite a lot by making minor changes that stack up over time and that the best way to do that involves reducing our reliance on motivation and will. 

All pretty intuitive so far, but what does this mean in practice? Well:

1) You need to make the thing you want to do the default option, in some sense
2) You need to get yourself in a situation where you don't have to go to a gigantic amount of effort each time in order to build a habit

The book also suggests that you need some kind of reward mechanism for engaging in the habit you're trying to build. I found that unnecessary, for reasons I'll expand upon in a little bit. 

# First things first

How did I make it the default option? Well that's easy, I just put the app icon for Duolingo in a really prominent place on my phone and decided that I would do it every day after brushing my teeth in the evening. So far so good. Thing is, this is designed to work really weell for a simple, bite-sized task that can be done based on a trigger like brushing your teeth. 

What about a blog? Writing these posts actually takes a little time to think and plan aside from the writing itself, which isn't necessarily quick either unless I've got something I really want to get off my chest. So, here's where another trick in James Clear's book helps.

I've gotten into an extremely foolhardy bet with [my friend Tom](https://lockwood.dev)
