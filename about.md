title: "About me"
---

I'm Stephen and I live in Sydney. I'm the head of ML at [iSentia](http://www.isentia.com), but used to be an economist and before that an aspiring interpreter. Life is funny like that sometimes.

This blog isn't really intended to set anyone's world on fire, but might hopefully provide some useful context. Also I reserve the right to go radically off-script where appropriate.
